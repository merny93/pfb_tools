    "## Forward PFB\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the PFB is to spit a stream of electric \feld data up into frequency channels, where the response inside a channel is at, and the response outside\n",
    "the channel dies as quickly as possible. If we had a very long electric \ffield timestream, the ideal thing to do would be to Fourier transform the electric fi\feld, then cut out a boxcar in Fourier space. The PFB tries to do this as well as possible and as efficiently as possible given the real-world constraints of digital signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic DFT will end up convoloving a box car function in frequency domain thus the first step in a pfb is to deconvolve with the box car in frequency domain which happens to be a sinc in time domain. Thus we create a de-convolving function which is a sinc funnction multiplied by a window (usually Hamming or Hanning) for out of band rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to effectivly average a couple bins together to get a more flat response inside a given frequency bin. This is done by averaging $n_{tap}$ time domain points together spaced $2n_{chan}$ points appart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put together this means we take $2n_tap n_chan$ points of time stream, multiply it by the window function and then sum points $2n_{chan}$ appart to get a psudo data stream $2n_{chan}$ long which will be DFTed to get $n_{chan}$ frequency bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one desires to PFB a chunk of data longer than $2n_{tap} n_{chan}$ then the same procedure as above is repeated but the data used is shifted over by $2 n_{chan}$ such that there is always overlap between the chunks being PFBed"

To do this we will need a $ 2 n_{chan} \\times 2 n_{chan} n_{tap}$ matrix which is Toeplitz with a diagonal full of ones and the $2tn_{chan}, \\ t=1,\\dots, n_{tap}$ super diagonal are also full of ones.\n",

    "## Inverse PFB\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are caught in a bit of a pickle. The first thing to try to invert the PFB would be to invert the PFB matrix. But it is not diagonal and thus the system is unsolvable (The PFB linear map is $\\mathcal{R}^{2n_{chan} n_{tap}}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}^{n_{chan}}$ hence clearly can not be simply inverted). \n",
    "\n",
    "But all is not lost. First of all, $F^{-1}$ is well defined so we can start by undoing that. Denoting the result of the pfb by $P$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = FSWd \\\\ F^{-1}P = SWd$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This has yet to fix the out of square problem we had before but all is not lost. Lets imagine we performed the PFB of a very large amount of data, say $N$ where $N >> 2*n_{tap}*n_{chan}$. In this case we performed the linear PFB map on many chunks of data. And recall that while $n_{tap}$ points get summed together (thus creating this problem in the first place) the PFB map is performed in sequence on blocks of the time stream such that each point is used $n_{tap}$ times. Thus as $N$ gets very large the number of output points tends to match the number of input points. Thus in the middle of the timestream where points are used $n_{tap}$ times we should have no problem inverting the PFB and we will talk about edge effects later.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets consider the matrix $SW$. This matrix is stack diagonal and to understand what it does lets recall what $S$ and $W$ do individually. $W$ simply is identity and weighs the input timestream (in linear terms it stretches space to colaps some dimesions and extend others) and $S$ sums every $2n_{chan}$ points (or in linear terms it collaps every $2n_{chan}$ dimension together). Hence $SW$ will look exactly like $S$, that is, it will be sparce with the $2tn_{chan}, \\ t=0, 1,\\dots, n_{tap}$ super diagonal being full of the eignvalues of $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence after doing the invers DFT we are left with $2n_{chan}$ independent problems. So lets consider a single one of these problems: the $2tn_{chan}, \\ t=1,2,3, \\dots$ timestream points. Consider some point of this psudo timestream and how $SW$ affected it. The first time the PFB was run (on a block of data containing it), it added that datapoint weighed by the $2 * n_{chan} * (n_{tap} -1)$, the second time it added that data point weighed by $ 2 * n_{chan} * (n_{tap} -1)$ and so on. So the $t$ time it was run it added $ 2 * n_{chan} * (n_{tap} -t)$ to the resultent psudo timestream. And this is true for all the points! Only differing when they entered and exited the block being evaluated. Thus we see that expressing the $2tn_{chan}, \\ t=1,2,3, \\dots$ timestream points as $d_p$ and the effective $SW$ acting on them becomes a band diagonal toeplitz matrix called $SW_p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are kinda done since we can \"almost\" invert this matrix minus for the ends where points were not used $n_{tap}$ times. A propsed solution (which is not the only one) is to create circulant boundary conditions. Thus taking the first few blocks and repeating them at the end to create a square matrix which is already by construction circulant. This gives us a couple great advantages like being able to invert this sparce matrix by convolving it with the psudo inverse denoted as $d_p$. Computationally this gives us the ability to perform it in $\\mathcal{O}(n\\ln(n))$ time with a really good factor in front of it by using the FFT implementation of the DFT!\n",
